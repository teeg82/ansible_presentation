- Gonna talk about ansible
- Ansible is a simple and easy to use task automation.
- Its chiefly geared towards application deployment and configuration management
  - We have a system we want to deploy with a minimal of hassle
  - We have dependencies we need to install. We have services that need to be setup and configured and run.
  - We want or need to the application to be capable of handling itself in different environments (development, staging, production)
  - And this must be done across multiple machines
- It can also handle zero downtime rolling updates and continuous deployments



ansible is an automation framework
  chiefly an application deployment system
  configuration management
  ansible is SSH based
    as such, don't need to install additional software on the remote entity
  ad-hoc task execution (not a new thing but useful)
  rolling updates and continuous deployment
  Multi-tiered orchestration (flesh this out)

Other task automation and configuration management tools:
  puppet, chef, saltstack

** Ansible documentation is some of the most clear and easy to understand documentation I've ever seen

Use cases:
  scenario in which you have a task or projec that requires repeatable processes and a consistent environment[1]
  immutable server architecture
    meaning, the ability to create, destroy and replace servers at any time without causing service disruptions
      aka: rolling updates
    makes ansible playbooks vendor-agnostic
      a playbook can be used across different providers and custom datacenters with little or no changes to the playbook itself.

Agentless!
  Nodes are managed by executing commands through SSH as a transport channel to deploy modules
    Commands aren't executed directly; ansible deploys small modules to remote nodes and runs those commands
  avoids the problem of having cumbersome management software. There are no open daemons running on your infrastructure.
    Aka no additional resources consumed.
  SSH is very common; considered "stock"

Ansible makes your life easier:
  writing ansible is quick and easy. Writing ansible won't become anyone's day job
  easy to read - can be read by people who don't know ansible
  playbooks can be committed to source code repository
  currently have a very large number of modules (postgres, django, python, yum, etc) ## GET NUMBER OF MODULES

Ansible is open source
  started about 3 years ago, took off very fast
  #5 in 2013 for most number of contributors
  very heavily supported, large group of contributors

Misc notes:
  ansible will try to manage all of the machines reference in a playbook in parallel [2]
